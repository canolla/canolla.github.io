                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    In recent years, the disconnection between young adults and the natural world has deepened as our lives increasingly revolve around technology. The fast pace of modern life—dominated by work, school, and other commitments can make it easy to overlook the profound benefits of nature, which offers not only physical exercise but also a space for reflection and mindfulness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Outdoor activities like walking or hiking provide a much-needed break from screens, offering fresh air, sunlight, and movement that promote both wellbeing and physical health benefits. Thats where TrailRanger comes in. TrailRanger is an application which aims to help inspire and facilitate outdoor exploration through gamification. The app targets where the target audiences attention is (technology) and aims to help connect young adults with the outdoors.

                        <p>For this project it was very important to gather some concepts and ideas which had been established with academically strong foundations. There were two general areas I was interested in covering, firstly the proposed problem, in relation to how young adults were losing connection with nature, and the potential nature and outdoor activities have to benefit them.  And secondly, the effectiveness of using gamification and intrinsic motivation as methods to help inspire and influence changes in behaviour in a positive way.<br><br>Looking at the core problem, I found from a report conducted on university students across Australia and New Zealand, 72% of students experience stress weekly, primarily from balancing academic work with other responsibilities. I also found another study which targeted young adults aged 18-24, finding that 58% of respondents stated being in nature and understanding what's around them is one of the biggest aids to helping them destress. Despite this early half want to be outside more but can't find appealing activities. </p>
                    </div>          
 
                <div class="para-4">
                    <p>From further research I also discovered that “green prescriptions” rather than pills were being distributed by health professionals in New Zealand. These perscriptions encouraged kiwis to spend more time in nature, provided cheaper access to local gyms and rec centres, diet and nutrition courses, and invited kiwis on trips. One survey found that of 3000 patients just over 60 percent of those said they were still more active than they were before getting their green prescription.<br><br>From this research among other insights I discovered it was clear to me that young adults are stressed and finding it harder to connect with nature than in times when nature was less prevalent. What was also clear is that nature provides a large list of benefits to young adults lives and wellbeing and that finding a way to inspire and make this more accessible was crucial to helping with nature reconnection.</p>

                <div class="left-text">
                <p>To try to answer this I delved into intrinsic motivation and gamification. I discovered a few key concepts, one of the core concepts was self-determination theory which offered a framework for understanding human motivation. It focuses on three fundamental psychological needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. These needs, when fulfilled, create environments that foster intrinsic motivation, engagement, and personal growth. </p>

        <div class="left-text">
            <p>I also delved into the Octalysis Framework, an important framework designed to help with understanding and implementing gamification strategies. The Octalysis Framework is framed around 8 core human drives as shown above. In this project, these core drives are instrumental in developing features that deeply engage users and provide them with rewarding experiences, encouraging meaningful progress within the app and
            increased interaction with nature.</p>
