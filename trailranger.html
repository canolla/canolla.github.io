                            In recent years, young adults have become more and more disconnected from nature and increasingly connected to technology. This has negatively impacted their overall mental and physical health.
                            <br><br>
                            Gamification is a concept that has been used a lot recently to make tasks like work and productivity more enjoyable and intuitive. With this project, the brief was focused on continual research and iterations. From this, I was able to take the problem of isolation and disconnection from nature and target where their attention is (technology) through a mobile app to make outdoor exploration a gamified experience. This project serves as the groundwork for future research and development in hopes that it could one day become a solution for connecting young adults to the outdoors and with each other.

                For the Lo-Fi, I had created an explore tab for discovering walks in your area or that you already walk, trail pages providing information on each walk, a community tab to find walkers in your area and what their opinions are on walks, a navigate tab for tracking your walk so you can review and share it, a quests tab for completing daily challenges and earning badges, a league tab for competing with others at a similar level and with friends, and a profile tab for displaying your stats, your reviewed walks, and your awards.

            Valuable feedback I took away from the tests were :
            <br>
            <br>
            - I found that people didn’t think that the monthly badge was required and wasn’t a factor that would be motivating to them
            <br>
            <br>
            - People thought that live weather updates from tracks using devices would be good
            <br>
            <br>        
            - It was recommended to make the trail search interface more immersive like Tiktok
            <br>
            <br>
            - Relabel the following tab friends
            <br>
            <br>
            - Investigate league progression further
            <br>

            - Make the navigation tab more interactive for better test
            <br>
            <br>
            - The navbar seems like its too crowded too many options

            <h3>
                I made some changes to further enhance the app through Social Influence and Relatedness’ and ‘Development and Accomplishment’. Firstly, I removed the monthly badge page, as this wasn’t found to be a big motivator, and replaced it with an events section that is integrated into the leaderboard tab and features social events where people can meet and competitions and challenges where people can earn awards. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I also made various other suggested changes, but I also missed a couple potential features, with one being league progression and how this affects users, and two being accomplishment interactions rewarding users for positive behaviour.
