                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                In recent years, young adults have become more and more disconnected from nature and increasingly connected to technology. This has negatively impacted their overall mental and physical health. Gamification is a concept that has been used a lot recently to make tasks like work and productivity more enjoyable and intuitive. With this project, the brief was focused on continual research and iterations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                   From this, I was able to take the problem of isolation and disconnection from nature and target where their attention is (technology) through a mobile app to make outdoor exploration a gamified experience. This project serves as the groundwork for future research and development in hopes that it could one day become a solution for connecting young adults to the outdoors and with each other.

                        <p>Being an academic research project, research and experimentation were the majority of the work involved with this project. I began gathering some academic resources that gave me some insights into this topic, allowed me to identify the problem, and allowed me to propose my research question.<br><br>From my research, important insights were gained into who the affected audience is and how they are affected. Young adults are significantly more likely to spend less time outdoors than other ages, and outdoor environments are vital for adolescent wellbeing, serving as a potential social outlet, and providing connection with nature.</p>

                    <p>One of the key resources I discovered that supported this project was the Octalysis Framework. This is a framework crafted by gamification pioneer Yu-Kai Chou that analyses human motives through its eight core drives.<br><br>With the research I found, I was able to clearly identify the problem, who it affects, and the approach I can take to help aid this. This led me to the research question, "How can a gamified mobile app be designed to help motivate and facilitate outdoor exploration among 18 to 24-year-olds?”.</p>

                    <p>The visual messaging and identity of this project play an important role, with a strong focus on gamification. One study suggested that rounded designs featuring anthropomorphisms evoked positive emotions in students. I experimented with three variations of visual designs and preference-tested them with the target audience. Results were mixed, but overall designs with a stroke were preferred. This became more apparent in the follow-up questions.</p>
