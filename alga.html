            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
            Iit’s estimated by 2030, 16 of the 22 Pacific Island countries will no longer be able to meet their current fish consumption. The oceans are a key resource for the pacific islands and they rely heavily on fishing. Seaweed is a major untapped market, and there are estimates that by 2030 seaweed markets growth potential of up to $11.8 billion.</p>
            <p>
               This is where Alga comes in, Alga plans to help the Pacific Islands utilise seaweed farming by providing an education program and resources to help the Pacific Islands break into the industry. This will help to regenerate local fish populations, while providing a new industry for the Pacific Islands to tap into.

        <p>Being the UX/UI Designer, I soley worked on the website. With the lo-fi and mid-fi prototypes I worked on making the website accessable for investors as well as regular people interested in donating to support the cause. What I soon discovered through testing and WIP reviews was that the website needed to better represent the brand identity and be more interactive and immersive presenting itself as a respectable organisation.</p>
