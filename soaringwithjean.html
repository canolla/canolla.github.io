            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                MOTAT (Museum of Transport and Technology), based in Auckland, wanted to commemorate their 60-year anniversary by opening their new science and technology center. My group and I were tasked with crafting a new interactive installation centred around the journey of Jean Batten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jean Batten was one of New Zealand's greatest aviators, achieving the first solo flight from England to New Zealand in 1936. The target audience we were tasked with designing for was families with children aged 5 to 12 years old.
            </p>

        <p>As a group, we developed our visual direction with the intention of creating an identity that captures the vintage feel of the 1930s while being bright and colourful enough to engage kids. The rubber-hose art style was a big inspiration for us throughout this project.</p>

            Sevarn, our lead visual designer, developed a Jean Batten character that would lead users through the Soaring with Jean experience. She's portrayed as an exciting and adventurous character who also serves as a way in which we can educate the children on Jean Batten's journey.

    <p>Beginning the UX/UI process of designing the Design-a-Plane experience, I delved into a few iterations and userflows to see what would be best for the target users to interact with. I decided that to be most effective, it was important to make the interface as simple and intuitive as possible. With the final iteration, I also took the design style from a flat display to a more rubber-hose inspired design.</p>
