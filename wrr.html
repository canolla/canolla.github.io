        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            In 2023, New Zealand grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
            <p>
            This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people including farmers who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.

                    <h1>Empathy Research</h1>
                    <h2>To begin with, I needed to identify a problem in the local community. So I began with conducting empathy interviews with 3 locals.</h2>

                    <h3>From those interviews I discovered that by far the biggest painpoint was the traffic problem which is causing a spate of other issues, so I decided to research further.</h3>
            
                    <h2>I then went on to conduct some bodystorming. I went out in the morning when people are dropping their kids at school and commuting to work.</h2>
                    <img src="/img/wrr/bodystorming-traffic.webp" alt="">
                    <h3>Through bodystorming, I was able to empathise further with the local people who had stated their opinions on the road in the articles I read. The overall experience of driving during those busier times felt unnerving and risky, especially when trying to turn out onto the main road. From stepping in a first-person view I identified these pain points.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Turning onto the main road at times could take minutes for just one car
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - During the school rush some kids crossed the road away from the lights despite them being recently put in place
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Some drivers became impatient with the traffic lights
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Very large trucks carrying cargo such as cattle were frequently driving through the street</h3>
            
                        <h1>Some existing solutions have been proposed and implemented</h1>
                        <h3>
                            - Traffic lights have been added next to the school
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - A bypass around Woodend was proposed but never implemented, and there are no plans now to implement this solution
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - The Government has announced plans to spend $35 million on improving the safety of a highway that runs through Woodend to Waikuku for construction in 2024, But National Local MP Matt Doocey says this doesn’t address Woodend’s traffic problem
                        </h3>

                        <h3>I discovered that by far the largest problem facing the Woodend community is the motorway which runs through the middle of the town bringing 1000s of vehicles including many Large trucks through the town each day. There is a solution for this which was announced back in 2013 by NZTA - building a bypass around the town, but since then the project has been cancelled. There have been protests and community meetings involving the problem, but what’s resulted from them have been a number of roundabouts and traffic light installations which locals have labelled “counter-productive”. It’s evident from this research that there is a major problem, locals are being ignored, and with another person added to the death toll in 2023, it’s only getting more dangerous and congested.</h3>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <div class="the-brief">
                <h1>The local residents of Woodend need to have a platform where their voices can be heard in an impactful way, invoking change, because their calls for action aren’t being met with answers</h1>
            </div>


    <h2>Problem and Solution</h2>
        <div class="problem-solution">
        <div class="process-content" id="problem">
    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <h2>Woodend is cut in the middle by a highway, which poses many safety issues among other concerns, and the voices of locals aren't being heard by the council</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="process-content" id="solution">
    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <h2>Create a solution that allows locals to sign a petition to support the bypass, have a collective of volunteers to advocate for the bypass and the option for others to join, and have a layout of different facts, stats, and public opinions on the traffic issue</h2>
    </div>
    </div>



    <h2>Visual Research</h2>
    <div class="process-content">
        <h1>Visual Research</h1>
        <h2>To begin with, I created a couple moodboards using visual inspiration from similar campaigns and websites as what I was aiming for</h2>
        <img src="/img/wrr/moodboard-1-2.png" alt="">
        <h2>I then created an updated version of the selected style, changing the background to light for older generations who may be using the interface</h2>
        <img src="/img/wrr/moodboard2-v2.webp" alt="">
        <h2>From there, I developed a stylescape featuring the logo I had developed, typography and colour choices, a campaign mission statement, and some UI elements for inspiration</h2>
        <img src="/img/wrr/wrr-stylescape.webp" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="process-content">
        <h1>Idea Generation</h1>
        <h2>I had identified the problem and empathised with the target audience, but it was time to delve deeper into the ideas and what would be the best way to solve or support a solution for the problems locals were facing</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>To begin with, I created a large brainstorm of different ideas that could be used as solutions for the problem. I then reduced the list to three ideas that stood out.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>
            - To have a petition that anyone in support of the bypass can sign 
            <br>
            <br>
            - Have a collective of volunteers to advocate for the bypass and the option for others to join
            <br>
            <br>
            - As well as have a comprehensible layout of different facts, stats, public opinions and stories on the traffic issue to give people an understanding and to raise awareness to gain more support
            <br>
            <br>
        </h3>

        <h2>
            To get an overview of the idea, I wrote a description of what Woodend Road Relief is for and how it can provide help
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Woodend Road Relief is a community-run collective aimed at bringing Woodend together to campaign for the Woodend bypass. With the dangers associated with the highway that runs through Woodend only getting worse, our mission is to push and raise awareness for the urgent need for a bypass. Despite previous efforts, the bypass solution has been scrapped, leaving residents in a precarious position. We understand the importance of a collective voice to bring about change. We give the community an opportunity to come together and get involved, with the ability to take action through petition signing and volunteering to push the campaign. With the community's support, we believe we can help make the bypass a reality, creating a safer and more liveable environment for everyone in Woodend.
        </h3>

        <h2>
            Finally, I did a SWOT analysis of the idea to poke holes in it and see what potential weaknesses it may hold
        </h2>
        <img src="/img/wrr/wrr-swot-analysis.webp" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="process-content">
        <h1>Prototyping and Testing</h1>
        <h2>With the idea, I began to create lo-fi prototypes, first as paper prototypes and then developing them into digital hi-fi prototypes
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Desktop and Mobile paper prototype wireframes</h3>
        <img src="/img/wrr/wrr-paperprototypes.webp">
        <h3>
            For the first lo-fi prototype, I was just transferring the sketched wireframes from paper to Figma to see how the screen layout and sizing were being used
        </h3>
        <img src="/img/wrr/lofi-v1.webp" alt="">
        <h3>
            Then, for the second iteration, I referred back to some of my field reviews to get an idea of the design aspects of some of the websites, which I could take inspiration from. I incorporated the colours and logo I used in my style guide, added page content, and made a few changes to optimise the design. 
        </h3>
        <img src="/img/wrr/lofi-v2.webp" alt="">

        <h3>
            I tested this lo-fi to see how users responded to it. I recieved a lot of critiques including:
            <br>
            <br>
            - Buttons Don’t Look Interactable
            <br>
            <br>
            - Add Facebook Share Button
            <br>
            <br>
            - Maybe Add Facebook Group Link
            <br>
            <br>
            - Things Feel Disjointed, Bad Spacing, Oversized
            <br>
            <br>
            - Buttons Not Labelled
            <br>
            <br>
            - Petition Too Simple And Similar On Volunteer Page
        </h3>
        <h3>I then created a hi-fi prototype, which addressed a lot of the previous pain points. I ended up implementing the Facebook share, comment section, and improved spacing, and I came to compromises in other areas, such as adding a second navigation to the footer instead of a sticky header, as the page real estate for each area of information was important.</h3>
            <img src="/img/wrr/hi-fi-overview.webp" alt="">
            <h3>For the Hi-Fi User Tests, I discovered that users found navigating the prototype a lot easier with the improvements from the Lo-fi. I also found that the mobile version felt a bit off visually for a couple of the users.
            </h3>
