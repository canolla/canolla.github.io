            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                In 2023, New Zealand grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
                <p>
                This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people, including farmers, who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk, and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.

                        <p>Beginning with research, I looked into some stats and figures to get an idea of the painpoints Kiwi's are facing. Some of the key insights I found were that 17% of 12-year-olds in New Zealand live in homes with moderate to severe food insecurity.</p>

                            Secondly, at the beginning of 2023, fruit and vege prices increased by 22%. Finally, New Zealand's yearly food waste produces over 409,000 metric tonnes of carbon emissions.

                            <p>Then I developed two primary personas to further empathise and understand the target audiences and their painpoints. The first persona is Melissa, she's a single mother who has been struggling to put food on the table. The second persona is Corey, he's a farmer who supplies local businesses with produce, but he's often left with surplus produce which goes to landfill.</p>

This helped me to pinpoint any potential holes in the solution which I may have looked over or not considered prior to mapping out their journeys.</p>
