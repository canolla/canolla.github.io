            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                In 2023, New Zealand grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
                <p>
                This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people, including farmers, who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk, and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.

                        <p>Beginning with research, I looked into some stats and figures to get an idea of the painpoints Kiwi's are facing. Some of the key insights I found were that 17% of 12-year-olds in New Zealand live in homes with moderate to severe food insecurity.</p>

                            Secondly, at the beginning of 2023, fruit and vege prices increased by 22%. Finally, New Zealand's yearly food waste produces over 409,000 metric tonnes of carbon emissions.

                        I then conducted empathy interviews with three local Kiwis to gain a better understanding of what their opinions were on food insecurity in New Zealand.

            <p>The UX/UI process began with gathering layout inspiration, creating sitemaps, wireframing, and lofi prototyping. In this stage I was getting a general layout for the website and how different features would be laid out.</p>

                <p>From what I had learned through user testing, it was essential to make browsing the site straight forward and as simple as possible for anyone to use the site freely. So I developed the Hi-Fi prototype with a homepage which aims to explain who Nourish Network is, what it does, and then guide the user to the map where they can discover Nourish Network locations.</p>

            <div class="para-4">
                <p>I also made the Become a Distributor page for those who wish to distribute produce, and a donate option for those who want to support the cause.</p>

                    After the prototyping process, with the user testing feedback I'd gained, I was able to move on to developing the website. I developed the website in VS Code using HTML/CSS/JS. I also used PHP to create a database to collect information from those who sign up to become distributors, and I connected Google Maps API to create a map of food distributors for users to browse through.</p>

                Finally, pamphlets are designed for the farmers market to give to those who attend, letting them know about who Nourish Network is and how it works.
