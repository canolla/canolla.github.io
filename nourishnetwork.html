                        In 2023, grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.<br><br>
                        This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people including farmers who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.
