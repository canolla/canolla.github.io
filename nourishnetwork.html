                        In 2023, grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.<br><br>
                        This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people including farmers who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.

    <h2>The target audience for Nourish Network doesn't have an age limit, but from research it was found that children often bare the brunt of food insecurity and have no control over their situations. So younger families and children were targeted in particular.<br><br>Two types of users were also determined, first 'the user' who benefits from the free produce, and second 'the distributor', who distributes their extra produce reducing food waste, and providing for those in need.</h2>

The process also delved into fun, colourful visuals shown in the stylescape, adding a playful element to the branding. Finally, an 11-page Brand Guidelines document was developed outlining how to use the brand elements.</h2>

                <p>The Hi-fi prototype featured a lot more detail and was almost production ready. Through user testing and from feedback via a work in progress presentation I discovered that the scale of a lot of the text and elements was far too large and the chunky aesthetic was decreasing legibility and ease of access.</p>
